        I am very interested in all things "dexterous" such as vim, typing, butterfly knives, and more. 
        <br>I currently am top 500 global in typing, with a 173:203 split (60s, 15s)<br>
        I've decided to start on a clean slate in terms of projects, but my past work involves<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Building and finishing an interpreter written in java
        <li> Building a pseudo-OS within the browser including a tiling window manager
        <li> Building a pseudo-terminal (separate) with an embedded word game inside (also within the browser)
      </ul>
